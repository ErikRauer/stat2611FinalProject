```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

To start, we want to import the data, which comes in two files. It looks like they aren't associated with one another so we can't compare questions from one with the other.

```{r}
firstPartData <- read.csv("2016 New Coders Survey Part 1.csv")
secondPartData <- read.csv("2016 New Coders Part 2.csv")

nrow(firstPartData)
nrow(secondPartData)
```




```{r}
sum(is.na(secondPartData))
```
