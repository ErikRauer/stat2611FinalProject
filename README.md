# Effects of Gender and Women-focused Interventions on Income of Computer Programmers
by Audrey Le Meur and Erik Rauer



In 2016, Free Code Camp conducted a [survey of its new users](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/2016-new-coder-survey/tree/c7eaf6b3da8e874e94d71960b6812a3e0ced0704), collecting information such as gender, last year’s income, expected future income, events attended, and bootcamp participation. Using hypothesis testing in R, we compared last year’s earnings and expected earnings across gender groups. Given that the average woman made more than the average man, we then investigated the relationship between women’s income and their participation in women-centered events and bootcamps. Our analysis showed that women who participated in women-focused events and bootcamps earned more income than women who did not. Future research could evaluate the existence of a causal relationship between participation in these events and increased earnings.
